Use template.php to make new pages

Any changes made to the .css files or the header file should be kept track of so everyone can make the changes 

Currently the top menu is unable to change links based on what page it is on and will be implemented when taught

Everything that you should be adding into your pages should be wrapped in the wrapper1 div tag which is already
implemented and makered in comments in the template.

The .css files are kind of confusing, that because I edited a free css template
