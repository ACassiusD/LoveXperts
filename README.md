# LoveXperts
This is a mock dating website called LoveXperts created by Alex Donnelly, Dan Munusami and Geoff Veale developed in our third semester 
web development class. As group leader during this semester long project was tasked with allocating work based on individual skills, 
managing the database and uploading the files to a live server along with building the website. No frameworks or JavaScript were used
in this project, the site was written from scratch in raw PHP and ran against a PostgreSQL database. I learned a lot while working on this 
project and I developed further skills with SQL, time management, and password security, sessions, cookies, and user views.
